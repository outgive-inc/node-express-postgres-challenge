# Outgive Full Stack Developer Coding Challenge

## Technology Stack Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) (PostgresSQL client)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Setup

The project comes with a dockerized development environment and should include everything you need to get working right away.

This setup requires that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your your system.

For **MacOS and Windows** users, you should only need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker Desktop includes both Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

For **Linux** users, you have to separetely install Docker and Docker Compose.

Once you download this repository, all you have to do is run:

```
docker-compose up
```

Depending on your machine, you might need to run the command above with sudo:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

The client application should now be running on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The server application should now be running on:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

When you make a change to the client and server source code, the respective Docker containers running will be udpated as well. In other words, hot-reloading is enabled.
